<p>This game is based off of the mobile game of a similar name. I wanted to learn Javascript, so I decided to recreate something that I enjoyed playing in order to learn the language. This also gave me the chance to learn more about the p5.js library, which is an open source, educational Javascript graphics library. As a constant student, open source materials have been vital to my education, and I hope to be able to contribute back to the community in the same way.</p>

<p>I don’t claim to be an artist, so all the design is very basic, mostly just using the built-in shapes.</p>

<p>The help menu isn’t working currently due to an unfortunate misclick and lack of source code control, but will be replaced before too long. In lieu of that, here’s a brief rundown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have 50 balls. The goal is to last for as many turns as possible before a block reaches the bottom row.</li>
  <li>Black blocks are <em>bombs</em> – when you hit them, they explode the square of blocks surrounding them. All other colors only indicate the health range of the block.</li>
  <li>Clicking the “return to hand” button while balls are moving causes them all to stop moving and return to the shooting position on the bottom.</li>
  <li>Pressing the escape key will start a new game.</li>
  <li>Clicking “help” will not help you.</li>
</ul>
