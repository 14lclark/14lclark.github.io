I"Á<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>My name is Logan Clark. Iâ€™m currently a graduate student in Mathematics at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>

<p>I passed my PhD qualifying exams in the following topics and have advanced to doctoral candidate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Real and Functional Analysis, May 2019;</li>
  <li>Point-set and Algebraic Topology, September 2019;</li>
  <li>Differential Geometry, August 2020.</li>
</ol>

<p>Recently, I have rekindled my interest in software development, which led me to make this site. Iâ€™m interested in open source, functional programming, and other topics.</p>

<p>I plan to blog occasionally about whatever Iâ€™m interested in at the moment.</p>
