# About me

My name is Logan Clark. I'm currently a graduate student in Mathematics at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri.

I passed my PhD qualifying exams in the following topics and have advanced to doctoral candidate:
1. Real and Functional Analysis, May 2019;
2. Point-set and Algebraic Topology, September 2019;
2. Differential Geometry, August 2020.

Recently, I have rekindled my interest in software development, which led me to make this site. I'm interested in open source, functional programming, and other topics.

I plan to blog occasionally about whatever I'm interested in at the moment.
